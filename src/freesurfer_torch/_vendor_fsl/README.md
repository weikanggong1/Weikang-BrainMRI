# FSL source snapshots used by the registration ports

This directory contains complete, unmodified source snapshots for the FSL
components consulted while implementing the PyTorch FLIRT, FNIRT, and
`applywarp` paths. The snapshots are retained for licence compliance and
reproducible source provenance. They are package data: `freesurfer_torch` does
not compile or import them at runtime.

The validation target is FSL 6.0.7.4. Its Linux package manifest fixes these
component versions:

| component | tag | commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FLIRT | `2111.2` | `5036b4620ea97db0050f2dc132fbb331dbba060c` |
| FNIRT | `2203.0` | `27f514a182b5972094e30d8ea79f4fad89cbf03d` |
| basisfield | `2203.1` | `9588bbe8eb8aa0939ddefd00df756aeb80d2305b` |
| miscmaths | `2203.2` | `7824d74cdfa9fb65de178f642c3c05e57c8c8868` |
| newimage | `2203.11` | `19e3ddd10138d8ea1394fd522fb0770435c61ddd` |
| warpfns | `2203.0` | `50ea45cb0b9661adba7844444cb38649ae44892b` |
| fugue | `2201.3` | `9d815181a19c4fe1aebac74e9fa6601cde4e1ded` |
