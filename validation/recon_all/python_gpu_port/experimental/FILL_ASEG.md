# Aseg-guided `mri_fill` port: fs_sub01

## Scope and source

The actual `recon-all` command is `mri_fill -a scripts/ponscc.cut.log -xform transforms/talairach.lta -segmentation aseg.presurf.mgz -ctab SubCorticalMassLUT.txt wm.mgz filled.mgz`. `-a` writes cutting-plane coordinates. The segmentation branch is `fill_with_aseg` in FreeSurfer 8.2.0 source commit `d932c45b7941662ea380a05efef580568b98d41a` (`mri_fill/mri_fill.cpp` SHA-256 `8f93f66aae7f1391a3314f3728a4301663d5c013a11bd9f9bdccc791ee0c544b`). It calls the UCHAR 26-neighbor Voronoi routine, 18-connected largest-component routine, and 6-connected hole removal. CC labels 251–255 are first replaced with left or right WM by signed fast-marching distance. Before this branch, the Talairach cutting plane can remove special WM values 200, 210, 220, 230, and 240. The output embeds the supplied color table.

`src/fnit/recon_all/fill_aseg_python.py` implements CC replacement, the aseg-guided fill, edited-on voxel voting, component selection, and hole removal with Python, NumPy, Numba, and SciPy. Its optional `cc_cut_mask` represents the preceding cutting-plane result. `src/fnit/recon_all/fill_cutting_plane_python.py` now computes that mask from the LTA, WM, and aseg, and writes the output MGZ with the supplied FreeSurfer color table. The complete aseg-guided `mri_fill` stage does not read a FreeSurfer executable or runtime package. It has not been added to the main recon-all entry point.

The original segmentation has 2,263 CC voxels. The native cutting mask intersects five special WM marker voxels. Using the original input, an isolated native rerun differed from the existing `filled.mgz` at **0/16,777,216 voxels**. The copied native runtime was used only to create references and time the official command.

## Numerical gates

| Comparison | Mismatched voxels | Algorithm time on headcw |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Python, experimental preclassified aseg and its matching native cutting mask, versus native on those same inputs | **0 / 16,777,216** | 4.69 s |
| Python, original aseg and original native cutting mask, versus original native output | **0 / 16,777,216** | 32.48 s |

The zero-difference original-input output has Fortran-order voxel SHA-256 `1ac2c3c86d90080b7f7c7b90dad491f8e97eba2634d97dc932993088c7de2bed`. The experimental preclassified-aseg output has voxel SHA-256 `b8739d9363486baf9b85ecd274a692aecc1b3f6a790ef17960758e386309ac74`. Ordinary Euclidean CC distance left 111 differences; the source-guided fast-marching initialization and float32 update eliminated them. Both comparisons still supply a native cutting mask.

The official `mri_fill` reference took 41.25 s on headcw with diagnostic intermediate writing enabled and 40.04 s without diagnostics. Both native reruns matched the existing `filled.mgz` at all 16,777,216 voxels. The 4.69 s figure is only the segmentation fill after CC classification and the cutting mask are supplied; the 32.48 s figure includes Python CC fast marching but still takes the native cutting mask as input. A second Python run took 32.86 s. These are not end-to-end recon-all timings or an equivalent speed comparison.

To rerun the exact-core gate from a machine with the NFS paths and project Python dependencies, set `PYTHONPATH` to the repository `src` directory and run:

```bash
BASE=/cwStorage/home/gongwk/Notebook_code/freesurfer_synth/work
SUBJ=$BASE/reconall_main_20260924/single_subjects/fs_sub01/mri
REF=$BASE/reconall_python_gpu_20260925/fill_ref
python validation/recon_all/python_gpu_port/experimental/check_fill_aseg.py \
  "$SUBJ/wm.mgz" "$SUBJ/aseg.presurf.mgz" "$SUBJ/filled.mgz" \
  --cc-cut-mask "$REF/cc.mgz"
```

This initial core check supplied an official cutting mask. The full-stage check below removes that dependency.

## Full Talairach and aseg-guided stage

The LTA type-0 VOX_TO_VOX matrix drives the same trilinear WM and nearest-neighbor aseg resampling as source `MRItoTalairachEx`. The Python seed search counts an 11×11 sagittal neighborhood, using the source's first-maximum scan order. It found `(124, 109, 92)` with score 103. Four-connected region growing, inferior extension of the cut, neighbor-based non-midline erasure, and reverse trilinear resampling produce the input-space mask. The source eraser accepts a non-WM center when the left and right neighbors are WM with different labels; requiring a WM center dropped two Tal voxels and seven final mask voxels, so the production code preserves that source behavior. The output writer embeds `TAG_OLD_COLORTABLE` version 2 from the 281-byte ASCII LUT.

Additional fixed input SHA-256 values: `transforms/talairach.lta` is `d5996cbdb5b1fc547a5ca71d3c8bc797f1cc259df177e8deba871c3125b82b1d`; `SubCorticalMassLUT.txt` is `65957c41244153d6614aeaf08c16ee956c09e2c8b5e198aa64c81946f75e93b6`. A diagnostic official rerun captured the transient Talairach-space cut immediately after `mri_erase_nonmidline_voxels`: `fill_ref/capture/cc_tal_captured.mgz`, SHA-256 `cfebc0480dc3539fee09312b3f511655e67d48fa7bc8f844fde329f121ffda80`. That capture has 331 nonzero voxels. The final official input-space `cc.mgz` has 589.

| Comparison with official fs_sub01 | Mismatched voxels |
| --- | ---: |
| WM Talairach binary sagittal slice | 0 / 65,536 |
| Four-connected CC region | 0 / 65,536 |
| Extended sagittal cut | 0 / 65,536 |
| Talairach-space CC cut after aseg filtering | 0 / 16,777,216 |
| Reverse-mapped source-space CC cut | 0 / 16,777,216 |
| Complete `filled.mgz` versus original official `filled.mgz` | **0 / 16,777,216** |

The complete Python output voxel SHA-256 in FreeSurfer Fortran order is `1ac2c3c86d90080b7f7c7b90dad491f8e97eba2634d97dc932993088c7de2bed`. MGH 284-byte header, 20-byte scan parameters, affine, data type, all non-command footer tags (including the 255-byte embedded color-table tag), and the 207-byte `ponscc.cut.log` are exact against the original official reference. Both outputs have eight command-history tags; the new final tag names the Python stage instead of the native executable. The compressed Python MGZ file SHA-256 is `3efcf1f06cb6b6cc9565fed52d858f32a960f7fa6fb1bb91b1e681cae66802c2`; the native compressed file has a different hash because the final command provenance and compression bytes differ. This is a voxel and non-command metadata match, not a compressed-file byte match. `check_fill_full.py` prints each gate.

On headcw, full Python CLI runs took **37.30 s** and **35.67 s** including input/output and imports with a warm Numba cache. The earlier isolated native no-diagnostics run took **40.04 s** on the same host; its output was voxel-identical to the original official output. These are individual timings, not a robust speed benchmark. All computations in this stage run on CPU. The runtime requirements are Python, NumPy, SciPy, Numba, nibabel, the input `wm.mgz`, `aseg.presurf.mgz`, type-0 `talairach.lta`, and the small color table. No FreeSurfer binary or runtime bundle is needed for the Python command.

To rerun the complete stage and validation with the fixed shared-NFS reference:

```

The Python API is `fill_mgz(wm_file, aseg_file, lta_file, colortable_file, output_file, cut_log_file=None)`. The tested path is the aseg-guided recon-all branch with a type-0 LTA and matching WM/aseg geometry. Other `mri_fill` option branches, other subjects, and cold-cache timing remain unvalidated. The native package was used only to generate comparison references.

An adjacent-stage replay supplied the independently generated Python `mri_em_register` LTA instead of the native LTA, while keeping the official `wm.mgz` and `aseg.presurf.mgz` fixed. The Python fill still matched all 16,777,216 native `filled.mgz` voxels, its MGH header and non-command tags, and the 207-byte cutting-plane log. The generated LTA differs from native by one float32 ULP in one matrix element, so this checks the registration-to-fill interface without rerunning the full subject. See [`em_fill_chain_report.json`](../em_fill_chain_report.json).
