# `mris_remesh --remesh --iters 3`: split phase only

This historical probe covers only the edge-splitting phase of iteration 0. The subsequent three-iteration Python stage and its fixed-T1 output validation are documented in [`REMESH_VALIDATION.md`](../REMESH_VALIDATION.md). The reference is FreeSurfer 8.2.0 source commit `d932c45b7941662ea380a05efef580568b98d41a`, `mris_remesh/{mris_remesh.cpp,remesher.cpp,remesher.h}`.

The pinned source was rebuilt in isolated headcw scratch with passive double-coordinate/int-face dumps. Its **one-iteration final** ordered vertices and faces were exactly equal to a fresh run of the installed FreeSurfer executable on both hemispheres. This establishes the source diagnostic as a valid reference for these inputs; the diagnostic binary is not used by Python inference.

| Fixed input | Native split passes | Vertices after split | Faces after split | Python vs source dump | Python CPU wall |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| LH `orig.premesh` | 118,835, 2,459, 476, 24, 0 | 223,483 | 446,962 | Every float64 coordinate and ordered int32 face exact | 6.90 s |
| RH `orig.premesh` | 116,335, 2,469, 933, 256, 0 | 220,548 | 441,092 | Every float64 coordinate and ordered int32 face exact | 6.72 s |

The Python probe follows the source's first-seen edge order, max-heap ordering by edge length and index, midpoint insertion, and triangle/edge updates. Its pass counts, ordered vertices and ordered faces match the native diagnostic exactly. CPU peak RSS was 563,312/572,356 kB for LH/RH. These Python times cover the split probe and comparison, while the native one-iteration commands include collapse, smoothing, I/O and intersection removal; they are **not** a speed ratio.
