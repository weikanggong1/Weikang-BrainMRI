# Talairach affine SynthMorph: frozen `fs_sub01` replay

This is an isolated replay of the published hybrid `rca-talairach` stage, not a
full recon-all run. Its archived FreeSurfer 8.2.0 (`d932c45`) wrapper invoked
`fs-synthmorph-reg --affine-only` and the native `lta_convert` program. The
archived `mri_synthmorph` line was intercepted by this package's PyTorch
neural tool (`FS_TORCH_NEURAL_TOOL mri_synthmorph device=cuda:1`). The reference
therefore establishes reproducibility of that **hybrid** chain. It is not an
independent comparison with the unmodified FreeSurfer TensorFlow model.

The actual network input is `mri/synthstrip.mgz`, not `orig.mgz`. The later
`fs-synthmorph-reg --test` call uses `orig.mgz` for a separate resampling check.
The frozen affine chain is:

1. `mri_synthmorph -m affine -t aff.lta synthstrip.mgz mni305.cor.stripped.mgz -j 4`;
2. `lta_convert --ltavox2vox --inlta aff.lta --outlta talairach.xfm.lta`;
3. `lta_convert --inlta talairach.xfm.lta --outmni talairach.xfm`.

The [Python stage](../../../src/fnit/recon_all/talairach_synthmorph.py)
uses the existing PyTorch SynthMorph affine model and a float32 source-order
RAS→voxel→RAS conversion, then writes the MNI XFM. It invokes no FreeSurfer
binary. The fixed profile needs the external `synthmorph.affine.2.h5` weight
and `mni305.cor.stripped.mgz` template. An isolated call is:

```bash
python -m fnit.recon_all.talairach_synthmorph \
  /subject/mri/synthstrip.mgz /assets/average/mni305.cor.stripped.mgz \
  --weights /external/weights --xfm /output/talairach.xfm \
  --lta /output/aff.lta --device cpu --threads 4
```

`register_talairach(moving, template, weights, output_xfm,
output_lta=None, device="cpu", threads=4)` is the Python API. The output LTA
is optional. The XFM comment names the Python writer; byte identity with
`lta_convert` is not a goal of this numerical check.

First, the archived `aff.lta` was passed through only the new Python
conversion. Its XFM matrix differed from the archived final XFM by at most
`1.526e-5` per element. This isolates the conversion roundoff from network
inference. A generic Surfa world→voxel→world roundtrip differed by
`2.670e-5`; the FreeSurfer-style float32 product order is closer.

Next, the same frozen images and weight were fed to the PyTorch affine model
on headcw CPU. The source hashes of `synthmorph/pipeline.py`, `models.py`, and
`spatial.py` exactly match the published hybrid checkout. Against the archived
GPU hybrid result, the newly computed LTA differed by at most `1.898e-5` per
matrix element. The final XFM differed by at most `3.052e-5` per element.
After applying both XFMs to the eight voxel-grid corners of the moving image,
the maximum and RMS position differences were `0.000136` and `0.0000935 mm`.
The complete [comparison JSON](talairach_synthmorph_sub01_cpu.json) records
all matrices, file hashes, errors, and runtime. The generated files remain in
an isolated validation directory; the archived subject was read only. As a
format check, the installed FreeSurfer 8.2 `lta_convert --inmni` parsed the
new XFM and wrote an LTA successfully; its isolated readback log has SHA-256
`454cf4cf5a05425b55806eadd5f4603e63992b037541485cc61afd3e62917d6d`.

The isolated Python process took 16.27 s with four CPU threads and peaked at
5,210,460 KiB RSS. The archived hybrid wrapper reported 10.65 s on gpucw1
with an H100 neural call. These are different hosts and devices, so they do
not establish a stage speed ratio. The focused conversion/API tests passed
(`2 passed`) in the archived Python environment.

## Remaining boundary

GPU execution of the new wrapper and TF32 numerical behavior have not been
checked because gpucw1 was not available in this validation. The existing
SynthMorph constructor disables TF32 for checkpoint parity; this stage does
not change that shared model setting. The independent unmodified official
TensorFlow registration, downstream consumers of the new XFM, and an
end-to-end Python recon-all call remain unvalidated.
