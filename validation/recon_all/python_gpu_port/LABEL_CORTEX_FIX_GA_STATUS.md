# Fixed cortical labels: FreeSurfer 8.2.0 comparison

The frozen `fs_sub01` recon-all log (FreeSurfer build `8.2.0-20260314-d932c45`) calls `label-cortex --fix-ga` before the separate `mri_label2label --label-cortex ... 1` call. The first command produces `lh/rh.cortex.label` from `white.preaparc`, `aseg.presurf.mgz`, and `entowm.mgz`. The later call produces `lh/rh.cortex+hipamyg.label` from `white.preaparc` and `aseg.presurf.mgz`. Thus the latter label is not the input to the former. `mri_surf2volseg` consumes `cortex.label`.

The pinned `scripts/label-cortex` sequence is: no-GA cortex label; `entowm` 3201/4201 binarization; 11 nearest samples from −1.0 to 0.0 mm along each vertex normal with a maximum; scanner-space normal x and z thresholds; intersection; `mri_cor2label`; ordered concatenation by `mri_mergelabels`. The Python port implements the fixed sequence in `label_cortex_fix_ga_python.py` and reuses `label_cortex_python.py` for the no-GA and separate hippo/amygdala calls. Native concatenation retains duplicate vertex IDs, as does the port.

## Frozen-subject result

Input: `/cwStorage/home/gongwk/Notebook_code/freesurfer_synth/work/reconall_reference_gpucw1/fs_sub01` on headcw. Outputs were written only to isolated scratch. The full recon-all was not rerun.

Fresh native replay of each child executable also matched the frozen official label rows. The native GA projection had identical values at every vertex to the Python nearest-neighbor sampling, and the combined GA masks were identical at every vertex bilaterally. The final official header has one space around the comma because the `tcsh` `mri_mergelabels` wrapper collapses the no-GA header's spaces; the Python writer reproduces that header exactly.

## Headcw CPU wall time, seconds

| Fixed operation | Native LH | Native RH | Python LH | Python RH |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| No-GA `mri_label2label` | 6.44 | 6.81 | Included below | Included below |
| GA binarization | 2.10 | 2.07 | Included below | Included below |
| GA surface sampling | 1.05 | 1.09 | Included below | Included below |
| Scanner normals | 0.62 | 0.52 | Included below | Included below |
| x/z masks, intersection, GA label | 0.52 | 0.43 | Included below | Included below |
| Final `cortex.label`, total | 10.73* | 10.92* | **3.89** | **3.67** |
| Separate `cortex+hipamyg.label` | 7.72 | 6.77 | **3.46** | **2.93** |

`*` Sum of timed native child programs. Headcw lacks `tcsh`, so the original wrapper could not run there. For native replay the binary-mask intersection used equivalent `mri_binarize` logic, and final concatenation used the pinned script's exact line ordering; wrapper startup and concatenation time are excluded. These timings compare the fixed stage on one CPU host, not full recon-all throughput. The Python port is NumPy/SciPy on CPU and is not yet wired into the main pipeline.

## Reproduce the output check

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python validation/recon_all/python_gpu_port/benchmark_label_cortex_fix_ga.py \
  /path/to/fs_sub01 /path/to/scratch/labels
```

The script raises an error unless all four Python labels equal the supplied subject's official labels byte for byte. The isolated synthetic merge test passed on headcw (`1 passed`).
