# `mris_volmask` white and cortical ribbon replacement

`volmask_python.py` reads `aseg.presurf.mgz` for its voxel grid, the four
bilateral white/pial surfaces, and the downloaded `FreeSurferColorLUT.txt`.
A Numba rasterizer finds where each triangle
crosses voxel-grid rays, sorts crossings, and fills the enclosed voxels. The
left white/pial mask assigns 2/3, the right assigns 41/42, and the left mask
wins at overlapping voxels, matching pinned FreeSurfer 8.2
`mris_volmask/mris_volmask.cpp`. The stage writes `ribbon.mgz`,
`lh.ribbon.mgz`, and `rh.ribbon.mgz` without a FreeSurfer executable.

On fixed `fs_sub01`, all three **16,777,216-voxel** outputs matched both the
archived and a newly run official `mris_volmask` exactly. The complete
decompressed MGH contents now match byte for byte, including the header,
voxel payload, affine, and FreeSurfer color-table footer. The footer serializes
the verified external lookup table with its supplied absolute filename; the
filename is part of the MGH metadata. The measured surface rays had no odd
crossing counts or buffer overflow (maximum 18 crossings).

| Same-input headcw CLI | Time |
| --- | ---: |
| FreeSurfer 8.2 native, four threads | 72.36 s |
| Python/Numba CPU, four surfaces and three MGZ outputs, including color tables | 3.46 s |

These same-host measurements include process startup and all input/output I/O.
The Python trial used a warm Numba disk cache. The measured speedup is about
**21 times for this isolated step**; it is not an end-to-end recon-all benchmark. A nested
cube test passed independently of the fixed subject.

The rasterizer stops when a ray has an odd number of intersections or exceeds
its 128-crossing buffer. The exact voxel comparison covers this subject's
closed surfaces; additional subjects and surfaces with mesh defects still
need validation.
